Software Engineer Screening Task
Overview
This is a technical assessment designed to evaluate your skills with modern full-stack development. You'll build a simplified project management system that demonstrates proficiency with our core tech stack and architectural patterns.
Task: Mini Project Management System
Build a multi-tenant project management tool with the following features:
Requirements
Backend (Django + GraphQL) -
1. Core Data Models
Create Django models for:
Organization (name, slug, contact_email)
Project (organization-dependent with name, status, description, due_date)
Task (project-dependent with title, description, status, assignee_email)
TaskComment (linking to tasks with content, author_email, timestamp)
2. API Layer
GraphQL schema with queries and mutations for:
Listing projects for an organization
Creating/updating projects and tasks
Adding comments to tasks
Basic project statistics (task counts, completion rates)
3. Multi-tenancy
Implement organization-based data isolation
Ensure proper data separation
Add organization context to all operations
Frontend (React + TypeScript) -
1. Project Dashboard
List view of projects with status indicators
Create/edit project form with validation
Responsive design using TailwindCSS
2. Task Management
Task board or list view
Add/edit tasks with status updates
Comment system for tasks
3. GraphQL Integration
Apollo Client setup with error handling
Optimistic updates for mutations
Proper cache management
4. UI Components
Modern, clean component design
Proper TypeScript interfaces
Loading states and error handling
Basic animations/transitions
Technical Stack
Backend: Django 4.x, Django REST Framework, GraphQL (Graphene), PostgreSQL
Frontend: React 18+, TypeScript, Apollo Client, TailwindCSS
Database: PostgreSQL (Docker/local setup)
Deliverables
GitHub Repository with clean commit history
Setup Instructions (README with installation steps)
API Documentation (endpoint list + GraphQL schema)
Demo (screenshots or brief video)
Technical Summary (decisions made, trade-offs, future improvements)
Sample API Structure
# Example models - expand as needed
class Organization(models.Model):
name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
slug = models.SlugField(unique=True)
contact_email = models.EmailField()
created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

class Project(models.Model):
organization = models.ForeignKey(Organization, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
description = models.TextField(blank=True)
status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=STATUS_CHOICES)
due_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

class Task(models.Model):
project = models.ForeignKey(Project, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
description = models.TextField(blank=True)
status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=TASK_STATUS_CHOICES)
assignee_email = models.EmailField(blank=True)
due_date = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
Frontend Component Examples
// Example interfaces
interface Project {
id: string;
name: string;
description: string;
status: 'ACTIVE' | 'COMPLETED' | 'ON_HOLD';
taskCount: number;
completedTasks: number;
dueDate?: string;
}

interface Task {
id: string;
title: string;
description: string;
status: 'TODO' | 'IN_PROGRESS' | 'DONE';
assigneeEmail: string;
dueDate?: string;
}

Questions?
Feel free to ask about:
Specific feature requirements
Technical implementation approaches
Scope clarifications
Setup or tooling questions
This task evaluates your ability to build production-ready applications with modern tools while demonstrating good engineering practices. Focus on quality over quantity - a well-executed subset is better than a rushed complete implementation.
Good luck! 🚀
